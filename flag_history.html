                    The Irish flag, often called the <strong>tricolour</strong>, features three vertical stripes:
                    <span class="green">green</span>, <span class="white">white</span>, and <span class="orange">orange</span>.
                    It was first flown in <strong>1848</strong> by <strong>Thomas Francis Meagher</strong> as a symbol of unity between the different groups in Ireland.

                <h2>The Symbolism of the Irish Flag</h2>
                <p>
                    <span class="green">Green</span> represents Ireland’s Gaelic tradition and its connection to the Catholic population.
                    <span class="orange">Orange</span> honors the Protestant supporters of William of Orange, while <span class="white">white</span> stands for lasting peace between these two communities.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The flag was officially adopted in <strong>1922</strong> after the Irish War of Independence, and remains a powerful emblem of Ireland’s identity,
                    independence, and hope for harmony between its diverse communities.
