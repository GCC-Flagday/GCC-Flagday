                The Irish flag, known as the **tricolour**, consists of three vertical stripes: 
                **green, white, and orange**. It was first flown in **1848** by Thomas Francis Meagher 
                as a symbol of unity between Irish Catholics and Protestants.
            </p>
            <p>
                The **green** represents the Gaelic tradition of Ireland, **orange** symbolizes the 
                Protestant supporters of William of Orange, and **white** stands for peace between both communities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Officially adopted as the national flag in **1922**, it remains a symbol of Ireland’s history, 
                identity, and hope for unity.
